üöÄ Approach 3: Direct Audio Analysis (RECOMMENDED)
Theory: Use ElevenLabs conversation's getOutputByteFrequencyData() ‚Üí Direct animation ‚Üí No audio file processing

Success Rate: 85-95% ‚úÖ

Why it will work:

SDK provides built-in audio analysis - getOutputByteFrequencyData() is designed for this
Real-time data available - No conversion needed
Mode detection works - mode: 'speaking' tells us when agent is talking
Lower latency - Direct data, no file processing
SDK-supported approach - Using intended API methods


Implementation Plan:

// Monitor conversation mode and get audio data
if (conversation.mode === 'speaking') {
  const audioData = conversation.getOutputByteFrequencyData()
  // Feed directly to animation (bypass audio file pipeline)
  triggerAnimationWithAudioData(audioData)
}

Pros:

‚úÖ Uses SDK's intended API
‚úÖ Real-time, low latency
‚úÖ No file processing overhead
‚úÖ Future-proof (official SDK methods)
‚úÖ Direct integration with animation
Cons:

‚ö†Ô∏è Need to modify VoiceReactiveVisual to accept raw audio data (manageable)
‚ö†Ô∏è Different data format than current pipeline (but cleaner)
